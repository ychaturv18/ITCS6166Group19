 # Topic : Real-Time Object-Detection

A deep learning-based object identification model for mobile and embedded devices called MobileNetSSD. It is a variation of the MobileNet architecture, which is made to be compact and effective so that it may be used on gadgets with little processing power.

A set of tools and features for processing still photos and moving pictures are offered by the open-source computer vision library known as OpenCV. It offers a number of algorithms for tasks like image filtering, feature detection, object recognition, and more. It supports a wide range of platforms, including desktop and mobile devices. It is possible to process photos and videos using OpenCV and employ MobileNetSSD-like object detection techniques. Developers can produce software that can recognize and track items by merging the two.

This project uses OpenCV to perform real-time object detection using a laptop camera. The plan is to loop over each frame of the video stream, look for objects, and then box up each finding..

# ML Model Insight:
MobileNetSSD is an object detection model based on deep learning that is optimized for mobile and embedded devices. It is a MobileNet architecture variant that is lightweight and efficient, making it suitable for use on devices with limited computational resources.
The MobileNet architecture employs depth-wise separable convolutions, which divide the standard convolution operation into depth-wise and point-wise convolutions. This reduces the number of parameters in the model and increases its computational efficiency while maintaining high accuracy. A single-shot detection (SSD) algorithm is used to train it to detect and classify objects in images. This means that the model detects and classifies objects in a single process through the image, making it easier and quicker than previous models.

# Web RTC:
WebRTC (Web Real-Time Communication) is a set of APIs that allow web browsers and mobile applications to communicate in real time. It includes audio and video streaming protocols and codecs, as well as tools for building peer-to-peer communication networks. Developers create real-time video communication applications with enhanced capabilities such as real-time object tracking, gesture recognition, and more by combining WebRTC and object detection.
