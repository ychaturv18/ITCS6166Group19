Project Details : 
Topic : Text To Speech 
There are a number of different TTS engines available, ranging from cloud-based APIs to locally installed software. Some TTS engines use pre-recorded speech samples to generate audio, while others use algorithms to synthesize speech from scratch.In this TTS web application, the user typically types or pastes text into a form on the web page, and then clicks a button to initiate the TTS process. The generated audio is then played back to the user, either automatically or in response to a user action.


Architecture Intended : 

Client Server Intended

Project Plan : 

1) project requirements. 
   tech stack : ReactJS in the frontend and Python flask for the backend.
2) Final AI model to be used.
  Using TTS python library APIs in the backend which's implemented on High-performance Deep Learning models.
3) Finalizing Design of the System in terms of Architecture in the first iteration of the sprint ie next weeks.
